This personal project is just someting I can add little odds and ends to so I can keep busy with react/nextjs.

All features added were games and tools that i felt could be used between within my friend group.

Such as Minecraft Bingo, a very niche game where a friend built a bingo game within minecraft with a specific set of items, so I wrote a tool to help get the random Letter/item combinations

There is also One Piece 20 questions, a game where you and your opponent can randomly get a character. After you have your character, you guess eachothers characters by asking identifying questions while also logging those questions and answers.

I also added a simple todo list, since no personal project is truely complete without one.
